# README: Whether Weather

A simple weather app to practice using the technology stack used by RoleModel Software.

## The Mission

> From Caleb Woods on November 18, 2022

**Build a small Multi-Location Weather Forecasting Application**

Using TDD and Ruby on Rails build a simple application that allows a user to:

1. Create multiple locations by (IP Address and/or text address)
2. ActiveRecord backed models
3. View the 7-day forecast for each location; highlighting High and Low temps for each day

Bonuses:

1. Chart the highs/lows
2. Leverage Stimulus/Turbo for some of the CRUD interactions
3. Deploy the application to a PaaS such as Heroku, Render.com, or Fly

Expectations:

1. Complete the application with ~3-5 hours of effort by Monday 11/28
2. Share source code through Github with a README that documents how use your program
3. Demonstrate ability to use unit and system tests with a strategy for handling data coming from 3rd party APIs
4. Use RSpec for tests; system tests in RSpec

Given References:

1. Stimulus/Turbo:

## Running the App

Use Ruby version 3.1.2.


## Generated README Content (for inspiration at project wrap-up)

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
